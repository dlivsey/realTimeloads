Description: Flux (mass per unit time) and Load (mass) are computed from timeseries estimates of analyte concentration and discharge. Concentration timeseries are computed from regression between surrogate and user-provided analyte. Uncertainty in calculations is estimated using bootstrap resampling. Code for the processing of acoustic backscatter from horizontally profiling acoustic Doppler current profilers is provided.
